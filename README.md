  ## Description

Eat-Da-Burger is an app that simulates the status of eating your burger at a restaurant. A user can add a burger of their choice and it gets added to the database. The app will display this burger in the first column. The user can choose to ‘devour it’ by clicking the button. Then the status of the burger gets updated and the display changes automatically.
